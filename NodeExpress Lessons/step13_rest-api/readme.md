# What RESTful API really means?

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is an architecture that allows client-server communication through a uniform interface. They are also stateless, cachable and has property called idempotence, which means that the side effect of multiple identical requests have the same effect as the same single request.

HTTP RESTful API’s are compose of:

- HTTP methods, e.g. GET, PUT, DELETE, POST, …
- Base URI, e.g. http://localhost:3000
- URL path, e.g. /api/todo
